# Matheus Goulart

## Web and automation developer

## 🖥 What I do

### 🏭 Automation

I like to automate processes that would either take too long or be too complex to be done completely by hand.

### 🖼 Front-end

Sometimes being pretty is important. I enjoy trying to present something to the best of my abilities.

### 📈 Data

Knowing your stuff is key. Processing data makes it easier to analyze it and, mor importantly, understand what the next step is.


## What I know

### 🐍 Python

The more I use it, the more I love it as a tool to solve problems. In the short spam of time I've known it, I already used for everything from processing raw data into actually usable, to automating video content creation, to making full blown web applications.

### ☕ Javascript / Typescript

I consider user interface as a very important factor in the overall quality of software, and no other technology comes close to this ones, along with html (And other templating standarts such as JSX and Vue) and css (And it's pre-processors) when it comes to making the final user's experience that much better.
